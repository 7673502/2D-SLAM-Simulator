# 2D SLAM Simulator

This is a work-in-progress Rust implementation of a simulator for [EKF-SLAM](https://www.iri.upc.edu/people/jsola/JoanSola/objectes/curs_SLAM/SLAM2D/SLAM%20course.pdf), FastSLAM, and GraphSLAM.

## To do:
- add options for non-gaussian noise (e.g. bias, slip probability) to the control and sensor measurements
- good UI
- start GraphSLAM

## Notes
- web deployment is working locally
