# 2D SLAM Simulator

This is a work-in-progress Rust implementation of an [EKF-SLAM](https://www.iri.upc.edu/people/jsola/JoanSola/objectes/curs_SLAM/SLAM2D/SLAM%20course.pdf) simulator.

## To do:
- good UI
- start FastSLAM
- start GraphSLAM
- change "dir" to "theta" everywhere

## Notes
- web deployment is working locally
